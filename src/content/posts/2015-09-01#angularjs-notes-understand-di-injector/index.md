We all know in AngularJs requried components are <strong>Dependency Injected.Â </strong>For example, if we need $scope in controller, we simply inject '$scope' as one of the parameters to the controller function. We are least bothered how we $scope object was created and given to us. This is called Dependency Injection.

### Dependency Injection is acheived by using $injector &amp; $provider in AngularJs. I will try to cover most of the important points related to $injector in this post.

In general Dependency Injection is achieved by annotations i.e using '@' example spring framework. However Javascript doesn't support annotations. In Order to provide DI angular uses a service called <strong>$injector</strong>. return object for $injector looks like

However $injector.invoke calls annotate &amp; get methods to resolve dependencies.

<span style="color:#0000ff;">$injector#get - Returns an instance of the service.</span>

<span style="color:#0000ff;">$injector#invoke - Invoke the method and supply the method arguments from the `$injector`returns invoked function results</span>

<span style="color:#0000ff;">$injector#has - Checks whether particular service exists or not</span>

<span style="color:#0000ff;">$injector#annotate - Returns an array of service names which the function is requesting for injection. This API is used by the injector to determine which services need to be injected into the function when the function is invoked. There are three ways in which the function can be annotated with the needed dependencies</span>

### Argument names
The simplest form is to extract the dependencies from the arguments of the function. This is done by converting the function into a string using `toString()` method and extracting the argument names.

{% highlight javascript %}
  // Given
   function MyController($scope, $route) {
     // ...
   }

   // Then
   expect(injector.annotate(MyController)).toEqual(['$scope', '$route']);
{% endhighlight %}

### The '$inject' property
If a function has an '$inject' property and its value is an array of strings, then the strings represent names of services to be injected into the function.

{% highlight javascript %}
  // Given
  var MyController = function(obfuscatedScope, obfuscatedRoute) {
    // ...
  }
  // Define function dependencies
  MyController['$inject'] = ['$scope', '$route'];

  // Then
  expect(injector.annotate(MyController)).toEqual(['$scope', '$route']);
{% endhighlight %}

### The array notation

It is often desirable to in-line Injected functions and that's when setting the `$inject` property is very inconvenient. In these situations using the array notation to specify the dependencies in a way that survives minification is a better choice:

{% highlight javascript %}
  injector.invoke(['$compile', '$rootScope', function(obfCompile, obfRootScope) {
     // ...
  }]);

   // Therefore
   expect(injector.annotate(
      ['$compile', '$rootScope', function(obfus_$compile, obfus_$rootScope) {}])
   ).toEqual(['$compile', '$rootScope']);&lt;/pre&gt;
{% endhighlight %}

This is how Dependency Injection is done in AngularJs.

Sometimes you want to get access to the injector of a currently running Angular app from outside Angular. Perhaps, you want to inject and compile some markup after the application has been bootstrapped. We can do this using the extra 'injector()' present document object.

In the following example a new block of HTML containing a 'ng-controller' directive is added to the end of the document body by JQuery. We then compile and link it into the current AngularJS scope.

{% highlight javascript %}
  var $div = $('&lt;div&gt;{{content.label}}&lt;/div&gt;');
   $(document.body).append($div);
   angular.element(document).injector().invoke(function($compile) {
     var scope = angular.element($div).scope();
     $compile($div)(scope);
   });
{% endhighlight %}
